**cpnt262 Mini Assignment 4 Framework Reactivity**

_Code Journal_
I struggled with the linking of the components, using the v-bind, double moustache and the v-on conditional. I found it hard to understand what needed to go where, sadly most of the videos I tried to learn from are 3+ years old. I find it very difficult to find new and relevant content to what were being shown. Seems a lot of resources are out of date, W3schools, Mdn etc. I am happy with the end result, but still need a lot of work on the organization.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
